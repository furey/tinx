## Installation

    composer require ajthinking/tinx
Thats it. This package supports Laravel [Package Discovery](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/packages#package-discovery).

## Usage
    php artisan tinx

### Reload your tinker session
    re()
This will allow you to immediatly test out your changes.

### Magic models

Tinx sniffs your models and prepare the following shortcuts.

| Example Usage     | Equals                                    |
|:----------------- |:----------------------------------------- |
| `$u`              | `App\User::first()`                       |
| `$u_`             | `App\User::latest()->first()`             |
| `$c`              | `App\Models\Car::first()`                 |
| `u(3)`            | `App\User::find(3)`                       |
| `u("gmail")`      | `Where "%gmail%" is found in any column.`   |
| `u("mail", "jon@snow.com")`      | `App\User::where("mail", "jon@snow.com")->get()`   |
| `u("id", ">", 0)`      | `App\User::where("id", ">", 0)->get()`   |
| `u()`             | `"App\User"`                              |
| `u()::whereRaw(...)` | `App\User::whereRaw(...) // chain as needed`                    |

The naming conventions are decided by a strategy function, for instance "shortestUnique".
Lets say you have two models `Car` and `Crocodile`. Tinx will then prepare the following variables and functions: `$ca`, `$ca_`, `ca()`, `$cr`, `$cr_`, `cr()`.

To see the names assigned for your session just call the function `names()`.

Please post issues and send PRs.

### Suggested improvment
* CamelCase naming strategy (CloudInstanceManager -> $cim )
* Add tests (this package is untested :/ )
* Eloquent should support static calls to getColumnListing. Workaround?
